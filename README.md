# Intramotev MSU Capstone Project

This repository contains the work for our Michigan State University Data Science capstone project, a collaboration with Intramotev, a technology startup focusing on autonomous freight car manufacturing. The goal of this capstone course is to provide data science students real-world project experience to develop their technical and professional skills. In this project, our team is working alongside Intramotev to develop an accurate object detection system that can be used on footage from their autonomous trains. This object detection was achieved using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm that uses a combination of provided data with pre-trained data. The team utilized YOLO V8 to analyze video and life-feed footage, adding a bounding box around each object and storing detection results.

# Installation

All packages and required dependencies are included in the provided yml environment. Once this repo is cloned, the environment is created, all files within the repository should be able to run.
